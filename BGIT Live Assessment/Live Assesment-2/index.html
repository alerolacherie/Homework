          <h2>Spaghetti Carbonara</h2>
          <p>Ingredients:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>12 ounces (340g) spaghetti</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup (100g) grated Parmesan cheese, plus extra for serving</li>
            <li>8 slices of bacon or pancetta, diced</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Chopped fresh parsley for garnish (optional)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Preparation:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Cook the spaghetti in a large pot of boiling salted water according to package instructions until al dente.
                Reserve about 1 cup of pasta water before draining.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, grated Parmesan cheese, and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper.
                Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a skillet over medium heat, cook the diced bacon or pancetta until crispy.
                Add minced garlic to the pan and cook for about 1 minute until fragrant.
                Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>
                Once the pasta is cooked and drained, return it to the pot while it's still hot.
                Immediately add the bacon and garlic mixture to the hot pasta and toss to combine.  
            </li>
            <li>
                Quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot pasta.
                Toss continuously and vigorously to coat the pasta evenly.
                The heat of the pasta will cook the eggs, creating a creamy sauce.
                Add a splash of reserved pasta water if needed to loosen the sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve immediately while it's hot.
                Garnish with extra grated Parmesan cheese, freshly ground black pepper, and chopped parsley if desired.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>Cooking Time: 15 minutes</p>
