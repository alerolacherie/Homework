HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. 
Its role is to develop webpages and web applications that run on browsers like Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome e.t.c,.
It serves as a foundational structure for web development. It is based on this structure that webpages are built

HTML Elements and Structure

Describe the basic structure of an HTML document.
The basic structure of an HTML Documents include:
HEAD: This contains the information about the HTML document. For Example, the Title of the page, version of HTML, Meta Data, etc.
BODY: This contains everything you want to display on the Web Page.
Below is how it looks:
</html>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>


List and briefly explain three essential HTML tags.
1. <html>
2. <head>
3. <body>

1. <html>:
   - This is the root element of an HTML document that encloses all other HTML elements.
   - It signifies the beginning of an HTML document, with the end denoted by '</html>'.
     - Inside the '<html>' tag, you typically have two main sections: '<head>' for the sites metadata and '<body>' for the visible content of the web page.

2. '<head>':
   - Contains meta-information about the web page, such as '<title>' for specifying the page's title.
   - It includes elements for character encoding, authorship, and other metadata.
   - While not visible on the web page itself, it's crucial for SEO and browser behavior.

3. '<body>':
   - The `<body>` tag encloses the visible content of the web page, including text, images, links, and other elements.
   - It defines what users see when they visit the web page.
   - This tag is essential as it represents the core content of the web page.

CSS Basics
Define CSS and explain its purpose in web design.

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
It is a styling language that is used to present the decoration and layout of documents for files written in HTML.

Some of its purpose in web design can be found listed below:
It helps when creating sites for different screens(responsive design),It adds more beauty and accessibility to the webpage. 
It also helps for styling and formatting e.g font sixe, font family, color, backfround color, e.t.c,

CSS Selectors and Properties
Define CSS selectors and provide examples of at least two different types.
A CSS selector selects the HTML element(s) you want to style.

The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name. e.g p{},h{} body{}
The CSS class Selector- It selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute. To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.
e.g .flex-container, .navbar, .flex-item etc.

Explain the purpose of the CSS color property and provide an example of its usage.
The CSS color property is used to format the text color of the HTML element.
e.g 
h1{
    color: white;
}


CSS Box Model
Describe the CSS Box Model and its components.
The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept in web design and layout. 
It describes how elements on a web page are rendered as rectangular boxes, and it consists of several components that determine the size, spacing, and layout of these boxes. 
The key components of the CSS Box Model are as follows:

Content: 
This is the innermost part of the box and represents the actual content of an element, such as text, images, or other media.
 It has a width and height defined by the element's content.

Padding: 
Padding is the space between the content and the element's border.
 You can set padding using the padding property. 
 Padding can be defined separately for each side of the box (e.g., padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left) or with a shorthand property like padding: 10px; for equal padding on all sides.

Border: 
The border surrounds the padding and content areas and provides a visual boundary for the element. 
You can specify the border's width, style, and color using properties like border-width, border-style, and border-color.

Margin: 
Margin is the space between the element's border and adjacent elements in the layout. 
It creates separation between elements. You can define margins using the margin property. 
Similar to padding, margins can be set for each side individually (e.g., margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, and margin-left).

Explain how you can change the width and height of an element using CSS

You can change the width and height of an element using CSS by applying the width and height properties to the CSS rule for the specific element to be styled. 
These properties allow you to define the dimensions of the element in various units, such as pixels, percentages, and more.
e.g
img{
   height: 5px;
   width: 10px;
 }
